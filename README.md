In this project, I analyzed two time series using the Box-Jenkins methodology. The first series was modeled as an ARIMA process, and the second series involved a combination of an ARIMA model and a deterministic polynomial trend. Key steps included:

Stationarity Testing: I applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests to verify the stationarity of both series.
Model Identification: Using the sample ACF and PACF, I identified the appropriate ARIMA models for the stationary series and determined the degree of the polynomial trend for the non-stationary series.
Model Estimation: I fitted various ARIMA models and evaluated them using AIC and 95% confidence intervals for model coefficients.
Residual Analysis: I performed residual diagnostics (e.g., Ljung-Box test and Q-Q plot) to check if the models were appropriate, ensuring the residuals were white noise.
Forecasting: Based on the analysis, I concluded the best-fitting models and used them for forecasting.
This project helped me enhance my skills in time series analysis, statistical modeling, and R programming, particularly with ARIMA processes and trend modeling.
